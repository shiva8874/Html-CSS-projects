        <h4>Hello, I’m <b>(Shiva Kant Tripathi)</b> and I work as a web developer. I have been working as a web developer for quite some time now. I believe I am a very ambitious person who loves to work on making the website work well. Working on the web is my passion as I love to work on exciting projects. This is the field I get to express my creativity. I would love to work in your esteemed organisation. This is all about me.</h4>
        <p>[I’m a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.]</p>
